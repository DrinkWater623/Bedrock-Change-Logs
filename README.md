# Bedrock-Change-Logs
**Plain Text Searchable Bedrock Change Logs**

*Well.. I was tired of combing change logs and not being able to search the way I wanted search.  I needed to turn off fuzzy searches.  I had a few hours.. so copied them all so I can do just that... And I am sharing it with anyone else that needs to be able to search their way.* 

I mainly included all logs with New or Changed features.  You are welcome to do a PR to add the fixes in between.

Suggested Use: Clone Repo and use
